EOS.IO Software-based blockchain boot tool
------------------------------------------

[点击查看中文](./README-cn.md)

`eos-bios` is a command-line tool for people who were not able to kickstart a
blockchain using EOS.IO Software.

It implements the following:
* Booting local development environments
* Booting testnets
* Booting consortium or private networks

See [sample configurations](./sample_config).


Local development environment
-----------------------------

[Download `eos-bios` from the releases section here on GitHub](https://github.com/eoscanada/eos-bios/releases),
clone this repository and copy the `sample_config` to a directory of
your choice.

Modify the `my_discovery_file.yaml` to point to a local address:

```
target_http_address: http://localhost:8888
```

Then run:

    ./eos-bios boot --single

This gives you a fully fledged development environment, a chain loaded
with all system contracts, very similar to what you will get on the
main network once launched.

The sample configuration sets up a single node, as it doesn't point to
other block producer candidates (skips the `peers` discovery).
