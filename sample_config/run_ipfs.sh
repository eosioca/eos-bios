# IF YOU ALTER THESE, EXPORT THOSE VARS FOR

#./ipfs config Addresses.Gateway /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/8081  # instead of 8080
#./ipfs config Addresses.API /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/5002      # instead of 5001, you'll need to use --ipfs-api-address /ip4/

# In the terminal where you call `eos-bios` and want to link to this IPFS:

#     export EOS_BIOS_IPFS_LOCAL_GATEWAY_ADDRESS=http://127.0.0.1:8081
#     export EOS_BIOS_IPFS_API_ADDRESS=/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/5002
